# Kalkulator-BMI

I write simple bmi calculator (indonesian language) code for fun and practice only. Might be developed if i learn python language more.

## How to run:
- Python 3 must have installed before run this file.
- Download bmi.py and run it on your terminal through where the python file is saved. In my case, i type `python "D:\pythoncode\bmi.py"` in CMD to execute the program.
